# Installation
* Sublime: Follow directions in link in [timestamp.py](./timestamp.py)
* Aliases: Backup current ~/.bash_profile & copy ~/.bash_profile into ~/ ()

# Laptop Setup Notes
* Solarized Light is Sublime color scheme
* After setting computer name and local host name, reboot machine to take effect fully

# TODO
* Move contents of .bash_profile into and custom aliases file that I can source in .bash_profile or .zshprofile, that way I keep it separate from nvm and other stuff that gets auto-added during software installs
